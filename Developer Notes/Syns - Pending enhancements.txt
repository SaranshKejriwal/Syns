COMPLETED_______________________________

Enemy to ignore Player if it is behind a wall. Enemy to chase PlayerTwo only if there are no obstacles in between. 
tweak the collider size to be able to correctly ignore players behind walls. Fixed by adding Box Collider to Players and a RaycastAll to Enemy.

BUG - Boss is ignoring PlayerTwo altogether, because PlayerOne seems to be overriding. Fixed by computing the closest player to enemy/boss

Boss stops moving after one attack unless Player makes a round trip. Fixed by Adding Exit Timed loops to Boss Animator.

Enemy is jaggy when it is just close to player. Fixed by increasing attack radius by 0.5f

BUG - Victory is not called if P2 enters door from the front. Fixed by Calling Victory when PlayerTwo is near door, not after entering it.

Bug - Grunt sometime jitteringly sticks to P1. Fixed by ensuring that if Enemy state is isDead, it doesn't change back to default.

Health buffs to be collected only if Player has less than max health. Done by adding a getter for MaxHealth

PlayerOne attack to find the enemy in front and do damage more reliably. DONE

BUG - Manage Player1 movement and attack animations more smoothly. Create Animation Events to freeze playerOne Movement while attacking. Handled in PLayerOneController to stop moving while punching
