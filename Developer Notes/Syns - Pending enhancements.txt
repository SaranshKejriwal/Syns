BUG - Maze renderer sometimes creates closed boxes on new level.

BUG - Next level starts without resetting the parent of Exit Key. Parent is set as P2 from Prev level.

BUG - interaction between P2 and boss is weird. Possible issue in Boss animator and P2 traversal logic..

Fix PlayerTwo exit entry using events. Level should only end when P2 is entering the exit. Ideally all actions on Level Win (like grunt death), should be based on an event fired by Edit door open.

PlayerOne attack range to be limited. Currently punch event is killing the approachedEnemy Object at any distance.

Create a healthbar component on all - grunts + boss + players, such that its length varies with indiv health. 

PlayerTwo Evasive Maze traversal when it runs into Enemy. - IN PROGRESS

PlayerTwo to reset past visited cells if Stack is empty. CONSTRUCTED. Needs testing

Addition of PLayer Hit and Death animations.

Addition of Player XP mechanisms. Increase player stats.

COMPLETED_______________________________

Enemy to ignore Player if it is behind a wall. Enemy to chase PlayerTwo only if there are no obstacles in between. 
tweak the collider size to be able to correctly ignore players behind walls. Fixed by adding Box Collider to Players and a RaycastAll to Enemy.

BUG - Boss is ignoring PlayerTwo altogether, because PlayerOne seems to be overriding. Fixed by computing the closest player to enemy/boss

Boss stops moving after one attack unless Player makes a round trip. Fixed by Adding Exit Timed loops to Boss Animator.

BUG - Victory is not called if P2 enters door from the front. Fixed by Calling Victory when PlayerTwo is near door, not after entering it.

Bug - Grunt sometime jitteringly sticks to P1. Fixed by ensuring that if Enemy state is isDead, it doesn't change back to default.

Health buffs to be collected only if Player has less than max health. Done by adding a getter for MaxHealth

PlayerOne attack to find the enemy in front and do damage more reliably. DONE

BUG - Manage Player1 movement and attack animations more smoothly. Create Animation Events to freeze playerOne Movement while attacking. Handled in PLayerOneController to stop moving while punching

Enemy visual radius to be cut from the other side of the wall. Done by adding Raycasts in GenericEnemyController

BUG - Player Two sometimes starts going to a diagonal cell, at the start of a game.. Is this a multi-thread issue? Fixed by removing Maze Starting Cell call in PlayerOne.

Enemy attack damage to be called only once on animation end, not infinitely while player is in range - Animation Event. DONE by setting up animation events for each attack type.

BUG - Enemy animation freezes after attack. Need to revise the animator transitions. Also - Enemy speed should be 0 during attack state. Fixed by adding a transition in Enemy animator back to attack start, if enemy is still in attacking state.

Spawn timer should stop when Boss Dies. DONE

Enemy is jaggy when it is just close to player. Need to ensure that it is not moving while attacking. Done by adding transitions from all attack states to Moving/Hunting.

BUG - Enemy Animation does not complete when attacking P2 at certain speeds. Not sure if this can be leveraged since P2 is running fast. Fixed by updating Enemy state after attack, and adding transition in animator to reinitiate hunt.

Enemy to stop moving while attacking. Checking if playerTwo evaded the attack. Done by adding correct transitions in Animator and Animation Events.

Multiple attack types on enemy - use Animation Events. DONE

BUG - PlayerOne attack only seems to work at a distance, not at close range. Root casue - EnemyInFocus was being reset because of old HandleInteractions() function

Make Grunt and Boss Icons for Enemy-side HUD - Ensure that it doesn't blob out at small sizes. Unity UI > Raw Image to be used. DONE

BUG - PlayerOne Punching feels weird sometimes. Armour is off and his head bounces independently from body.. Somehow FIXED after rebuild.
